# Question 02 (15 points)

```{r}

# Get the data for PSXP and calulate the returns and the volatility
LNNdata <- get.hist.quote('LNN', quote="Close")
LNNret <- log(lag(LNNdata)) - log(LNNdata)
LNNvol <- sd(LNNret) * sqrt(250) * 100

# Function to get volatility in continuous lookback window
Vol <- function(d, logrets) {
  var=0
  lam=0
  varlist<-c()
  for(r in logrets) {
    lam=lam*(1-1/d)+1
    var=(1-1/lam)*var+(1/lam)*r^2
    varlist<-c(varlist,var)
  }
  sqrt(varlist)
}

# Get different volatilities
volest <- Vol(10, LNNret)
volest2 <- Vol(30, LNNret)
volest3 <- Vol(100, LNNret)

plot(volest,type="l")
lines(volest2,type="l",col="red")
lines(volest3,type="l",col="blue")

```{r}

# Comparing the graphs below are a few observations:
# 1.	Being the highest difference in the city does not mean the highest difference in the country and vice versa
# 2.	The top 3rd city is Moscow and the top 3rd country is Russia which is a coincidence.
# 3.	Also, there is a pattern, lot of cities in China and Russia are in the top differences and hence the country is also in the top
